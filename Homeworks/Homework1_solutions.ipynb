Remember to restart the kernel, run all cells and check the outputs before saving and downloading the final version of the notebook for submission.\n",

    "5. You can search for helpful functions and code to achieve specific tasks like \"how to code an 'and' condition in Python\" or \"how to print multiple strings in the same line in Python\" but you may not post the specific questions online or otherwise seek help in answering the specific homework questions. Doing so will result in a zero on the assignment and could result in a failing grade in the course. Please **CHECK THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY SECTION IN THE SYLLABUS** for complete information. It is your responsibility to understand and follow the academic integrity guidelines."
