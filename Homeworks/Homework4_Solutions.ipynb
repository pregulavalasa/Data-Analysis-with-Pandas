You can search for helpful functions and code to achieve specific tasks like \"how to code an 'and' condition in Python\" or \"how to print multiple strings in the same line in Python\" but you may not post the specific questions online or otherwise seek help in answering the specific homework questions. Doing so will result in a zero on the assignment and could result in a failing grade in the course. Please **CHECK THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY SECTION IN THE SYLLABUS** for complete information. "

    "The code cell below defines two lists - first_list and second_list. Each of the two lists contains some strings. Create a new blank list called combined_list. Then, you must combine the corresponding elements of the two lists (that is, combine the first string of first_list ('I\") with the first element of the second_list (\"\") to create a new string \"I\" and add it as the first element of combined_list.  Next, create a new string which combines the second elements of first_list and second_list and add it as the second element of combined_list. Continue this process until you have processed all elements of first_list and second_list. Finally print the strings in combined_list in one line and separated by a single space. It is okay to assume that both lists will have the same count of elements. However, your code should work even if we edit the two lists to include more or less than 4 elements.\n",
